# Focus Mode
The purpose of the Focus Mode plugin is to quickly switch into a distraction-free mode or "zen" mode.  This plugin allows you to quickly toggle into fullscreen mode and hide elements like the sidebar or properties section.

* Hide Side Bar: will hide the left sidebar when you enter into focus mode.
* Go Fullscreen: will toggle full-screen mode while in focus mode.
* Hide properties: will hide the properties block at the top of the page.
